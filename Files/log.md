	which are present in list b.

	- ### Thoughts:		 
		```
		First I thought 'this is a easy one'.

	Maybe find a solution next week...

## Day 1 - Round 1
#### December 09, 2019
- ### Today's Progress:
	One hour c# tutorial at https://www.sololearn.com/. It was a very simple tutorial for getting on the platform. The basics were discussed on the following topics: Conditionals and Loops, Methods, Classes & Objects.

	Struggled a bit with git repo. had to setup .gitignore right. 
	Than did a little challenge at codwars. I had to create a function that 
	removes the spaces from a given string, then returns the resultant string. 

	- ### Thoughts:
		During this challange I want to:
		```
		- Learn 1 hours (online-tutorials)

		```

	- ### Thoughts:		 
		```
		I want to use this 100-day challange to deepen my programming skills and abilities. 
		Unfortunately, I did not have much time to create effective code during the lesson, 
		as I first had to learn a lot about GitHub.

# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Dominic Gerweck

## Day 52 - Round 1

#### January 29, 2020

## Today's Progress:

- Finished my daily lesson @freeCodeCamp
- Finished a course @Udemy ['Build Your First Website in 1 Week with HTML5 and CSS3'](https://www.udemy.com/share/101rHACUIYdFZSQns=/) made from [@RyanBonhardt](https://twitter.com/RyanBonhardt).

## Thoughts

To take a break yesterday feels like a total refresh.

## Daily Code Snippets

### JavaScript

#### Record Collection

You are given a JSON object representing a part of your musical album collection. Each album has several properties and a unique id number as its key. Not all albums have complete information.

Write a function which takes an album's id (like 2548), a property prop (like "artist" or "tracks"), and a value (like "Addicted to Love") to modify the data in this collection.

If prop isn't "tracks" and value isn't empty (""), update or set the value for that record album's property.

Your function must always return the entire collection object.

There are several rules for handling incomplete data:

If prop is "tracks" but the album doesn't have a "tracks" property, create an empty array before adding the new value to the album's corresponding property.

If prop is "tracks" and value isn't empty (""), push the value onto the end of the album's existing tracks array.

If value is empty (""), delete the given prop property from the album.

Hints
Use bracket notation when accessing object properties with variables.

Push is an array method you can read about on Mozilla Developer Network.

You may refer back to Manipulating Complex Objects Introducing JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) for a refresher.

```javascript
// Setup
var collection = {
  2548: {
    album: "Slippery When Wet",
    artist: "Bon Jovi",
    tracks: ["Let It Rock", "You Give Love a Bad Name"]
  },
  2468: {
    album: "1999",
    artist: "Prince",
    tracks: ["1999", "Little Red Corvette"]
  },
  1245: {
    artist: "Robert Palmer",
    tracks: []
  },
  5439: {
    album: "ABBA Gold"
  }
};

// Alter values below to test your code
updateRecords(5439, "artist", "ABBA");
```

Solution:

```javascript
function updateRecords(id, prop, value) {
  if (value === "") {
    delete collection[id][prop];
  } else if (prop === "tracks") {
    collection[id][prop] = collection[id][prop] || [];
    collection[id][prop].push(value);
  } else {
    collection[id][prop] = value;
  }

  return collection;
}

// Alter values below to test your code
updateRecords(2468, "tracks", "test");

console.log(updateRecords(5439, "artist", "ABBA"));
```

## Day 47 - Round 1

#### January 24, 2020

## Today's Progress:

Started this day with some lessons about objects in JavaScript [@freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn). Than I started working on my "real-world" WebSite project. Soon I realized, my coding skills are not good enough to work as fast as I need/want to right now. That's why I first did some YT tutorials about getting Gatsby.js started and how to use it with bootstrap and bootstrap react.

## Thoughts

Gatsby.js is very great, but I **need** to learn deeper and more about react components to get my work finished.

```
Learning WebDevelopment can be hard ...
But it still feels soooo amazing for me
```

## Projects

- ### "real-world" WebSite project

  - add a navbar and a footer as components

## Daily Code Snippets

### JavaScript

#### Using Objects for Lookups

Convert the switch statement into an object called lookup. Use it to look up val and assign the associated string to the result variable.

```javascript
// Setup
function phoneticLookup(val) {
  var result = "";

  // Only change code below this line
  switch (val) {
    case "alpha":
      result = "Adams";
      break;
    case "bravo":
      result = "Boston";
      break;
    case "charlie":
      result = "Chicago";
      break;
    case "delta":
      result = "Denver";
      break;
    case "echo":
      result = "Easy";
      break;
    case "foxtrot":
      result = "Frank";
  }

  // Only change code above this line
  return result;
}
```

Solution:

```javascript
// Setup
function phoneticLookup(val) {
  var result = "";

  // Only change code below this line

  var lookup = {
    alpha: "Adams",
    bravo: "Boston",
    charlie: "Chicago",
    delta: "Denver",
    echo: "Easy",
    foxtrot: "Frank"
  };

  result = lookup[val];

  // Only change code above this line
  return result;
}
```

## Day 46 - Round 1

#### January 23, 2020

## Today's Progress:

Today I had a job interview and was invited to stay for the rest of the day and do a short intership/trial work. It was very late but a great day.

Did a short lesson as usal [@freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).

## Tutorials

### JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures' Certification at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/counting-cards)

Today I finished 1 lesson:

- [x] Counting Cards

## Daily Codesnippets

### JavaScript

#### Counting Cards

In the casino game Blackjack, a player can gain an advantage over the house by keeping track of the relative number of high and low cards remaining in the deck. This is called Card Counting.

Having more high cards remaining in the deck favors the player. Each card is assigned a value according to the table below. When the count is positive, the player should bet high. When the count is zero or negative, the player should bet low.

| Count Change | Cards                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| +1           | 2, 3, 4, 5, 6          |
| 0            | 7. 8. 9                |
| -1           | 10, 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A' |

You will write a card counting function. It will receive a card parameter, which can be a number or a string, and increment or decrement the global count variable according to the card's value (see table). The function will then return a string with the current count and the string Bet if the count is positive, or Hold if the count is zero or negative. The current count and the player's decision (Bet or Hold) should be separated by a single space.

Example Output

```
-3 Hold
5 Bet
```

- Do NOT reset count to 0 when value is 7, 8, or 9.
- Do NOT return an array.
- Do NOT include quotes (single or double) in the output.

```javascript
function cc(card) {
  switch (card) {
    case 2:
    case 3:
    case 4:
    case 5:
    case 6:
      count++;
      break;
    case 10:
    case "J":
    case "Q":
    case "K":
    case "A":
      count--;
      break;
  }

  var holdbet = "Hold";
  if (count > 0) {
    holdbet = "Bet";
  }

  return count + " " + holdbet;
}
```

  } else if (val === 1) {
    answer = "There is no #1";
  } else if (val === 99) {
    answer = "Missed me by this much!";
  } else if (val === 7) {
    answer = "Ate Nine";
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  switch (val) {
    case "bob":
      answer = "Marley";
      break;
    case 42:
      answer = "The Answer";
      break;

## Day 39 - Round 1

#### January 16, 2020

## Today's Progress:

Today I solved a problem named "Popsicles" @SoloLearn. Did my daily tutorial @freeCodeCamp.

I Finished this day with a little jQuery course @Udemy. It covers the basics for beginner.

## Tutorials

- ### JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures' Certification at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)

  Today I finished 1 lesson:

  - [x] Introducing Else Statements

- ### Learn Basic JQuery at [UDEMY](https://www.udemy.com/share/101T9ICUIYdFZSQns=/)
  - [x] completed the course (see Images)

## Coding Challenges

### CodeCoach at [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/)

- ### Challenge: Popsicles

  You have a box of popsicles and you want to give them all away to a group of brothers and sisters. If you have enough left in the box to give them each an even amount you should go for it! If not, they will fight over them, and you should eat them yourself later.

  #### Task

  Given the number of siblings that you are giving popsicles to, determine if you can give them each an even amount or if you shouldn't mention the popsicles at all.

  #### Input Format

  Two integer values, the first one represents the number of siblings, and the second one represents the number of popsicles that you have left in the box.

  #### Output Format

  A string that says 'give away' if you are giving them away, or 'eat them yourself' if you will be eating them yourself.

  #### Sample Input

  3 9

  #### Sample Output

  give away

  ## My Solution

  ```csharp
  if ((popsicles % siblings) == 0)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("give away");
  }
  else
  {
    Console.WriteLine("eat them yourself");
  }
  ```

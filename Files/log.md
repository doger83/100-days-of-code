### Thoughts

First I thought 'this is a easy one'. But after 1 houre trying all Array method I know,I didn¬¥t pass all the Tests. With one solution, the first test would be passed and with the other the last test.

    Maybe find a solution next week...

One hour c# tutorial at https://www.sololearn.com/. It was a very simple tutorial for getting on the platform. The basics were discussed on the following topics: Conditionals and Loops, Methods, Classes & Objects.

Struggled a bit with git repo. had to setup .gitignore right. Than did a little challenge at codwars. I had to create a function that removes the spaces from a given string, then returns the resultant string.

I want to use this 100-day challange to deepen my programming skills and abilities.

    Unfortunately, I did not have much time to create effective code during the lesson, as I first had to learn a lot about GitHub.

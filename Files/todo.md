## Challenges

### KATA Arry.diff at [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/523f5d21c841566fde000009)
Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

- ### Details
	It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

	```csharp
	Kata.ArrayDiff(new int[] {1, 2}, new int[] {1}) => new int[] {2}		
	```

	If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

	```csharp
	Kata.ArrayDiff(new int[] {1, 2, 2, 2, 3}, new int[] {2}) => new int[] {1, 3}
	```

- ### Solution
	Not finished jet!

	```csharp
	public static int[] Solution (int[] a, int[] b) 
	{
		int[] result = a;

		// not finished jet!
		// TODO : find solution for the KATA from codewars (Array.Diff)

		return result;
	}
	```

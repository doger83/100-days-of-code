### KATA Arry.diff [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/523f5d21c841566fde000009)
Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

- ### Details
    - #### It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

        ```csharp
        Kata.ArrayDiff(new int[] {1, 2}, new int[] {1}) => new int[] {2}		
        ```

    - #### If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

        ```csharp
        Kata.ArrayDiff(new int[] {1, 2, 2, 2, 3}, new int[] {2}) => new int[] {1, 3}
        ```

    - #### Solution
        Not finished yet.

        ```csharp
        public static int[] Solution (int[] a, int[] b) 
        {
            int[] result = a;

            // not finished jet!
            // TODO : find solution for the KATA from codewars (Array.Diff)

            return result;
        }
        ```
